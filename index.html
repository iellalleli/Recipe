                            <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>
                            <li>1 package (12 ounes) firm tofu</li>
                            <li>1 onion, peeled and chopped</li>
                            <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
                            <li>1 large Japanese yam (camote), peeled and cut into 1-inch lengths matchsticks</li>
                            <li>½ cup water</li>
                            <li>2 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch lengths matchsticks</li>
                            <li>½ head cabbage, shredded</li>
                            <li>4 cups bean sprouts <i>togi</i></li>
                            <li>12 spring roll wrappers</li>
                            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

                    <p><b>Procedure:</b></p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Drain tofu from packing liquid. Pat dry with paper towels to absorb moisture. Cut into ½- inch cubes.</li>
                            <li>In a wide skillet over medium heat, heat about 2 tablespoons of oil until very hot. Add tofu and cook until crisp and lightly browned. Remove from pan and drain on paper towels. Keep warm.</li>
                            <li>Add onions and garlic and cook until softened.</li>
                            <li>Add camote and water. Cook until camote is tender and most of liquid is absorbed.</li>
                            <li>Add carrots and cook for about 1 minute or until half-done.</li>
                            <li>Add cabbage and tofu. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Add bean sprouts and stir-fry briefly for about 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook until vegetables are tender yet crisp.</li>
                            <li>Remove the vegetable mixture from heat and drain in a strainer. Let cool completely.</li>
                            <li>Separate wrappers into individual sheets. On a flat working surface, lay wrapper like a diamond.</li>
                            <li>Spoon about 2 tablespoons of vegetable mixture in the middle of the wrapper.</li>
                            <li>Fold the bottom corner over the filling and then fold in sides. Starting at the bottom, roll up the wrapper to form a tight log around the filling. Repeat with the remaining mixture.</li>
                            <li>In a skillet over medium heat, heat about 2-inch deep oil. Add spring rolls seam side down and fry, turning once or twice, for about 2 to 3 minutes on each side or until golden brown.</li>
                            <li>Remove from pan and drain on a wire rack set over a baking sheet. Serve immediately.</li>

                            <li>Cut the vegetables into thin, uniform sizes to ensure quick and even cooking.</li>
                            <li>Stir-fry the vegetables a bit underdone, as they will continue to cook in the residual heat and during the lumpia's frying.</li>
                            <li>Drain the vegetable filling well and cool completely before wrapping, as excess moisture or steam will tear the spring roll wrapper. Place the drained mixture in the refrigerator for a few minutes to cool quickly and prevent it from cooking further.</li>
                            <li>Cover the lumpia wrappers with a damp cloth while assembling to prevent them from drying out.</li>
                            <li>Roll the lumpia tightly and snugly to keep the oil from seeping in. Do not overfill to prevent it from bursting.</li>

                            <li>Lower heat and simmer for about 40 to 60 minutes until tender. Drain pork well and reserve the cooking liquid.</li>

                            <li>In a bowl, beat the egg whites using a mixer at low speed for 2 to 3 minutes or until soft peaks form.</li>
                            <li>Gradually add ¼ cup of the granulated sugar, a tablespoon at a time, while continuously beating. Once all sugar is added, turn up the speed to medium and continue beating the meringue until it forms stiff glossy peaks. Set aside.</li>
                            <li>In a separate bowl, cream the butter and remaining ¼ cup sugar for 3 minutes or until light in color.</li>
                            <li>Add the yolks one at a time while continuously mixing for about 2 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Add milk, cake flour, baking powder, and vanilla extract to the egg yolk mixture.  Beat until batter for about 2 minutes or until smooth.</li>
                            <li>Gently fold in a third of the meringue into the egg yolk mixture and then add the remaining meringue and fold until well combined.</li>
                            <li>Pour into prepared pan and bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.</li>
                            <li>Remove from oven and let the cake cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before completely removing from pan to a cooling rack. Remove the parchment paper off the cake and let it cool down before frosting.</li>

                            <li>Spoon about ¼ of the yema on top of the bottom cake half layer. Using a spatula, spread evenly to cover the surface with about ⅛-inch thick of yema filling.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Eggs are easier to separate when cold, but allow the egg whites to reach room temperature before whisking to create more volume.</li>
                            <li>Use eggs that are fresh if possible, they might not create as much volume as older (3-5 day-old) eggs, but they make a more stable meringue.</li>
                            <li>Make sure there is no grease, fat, or even a smear of yolk in the whites, which will prevent them from foaming properly.</li>
                            <li>For best results, use clean, grease-free bowls and whisk attachments. Use glass or metal bowls, as plastic can have a greasy film that will keep the whites from whipping up to full volume.</li>
                            <li>Avoid using high speed while whisking or beating the whites. As it incorporates more air and creates larger bubbles, it deflates the meringue during or after baking.</li>
                            <li>Fold the meringue gently into the batter in parts and in one direction to keep from deflating it.</li>
